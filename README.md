# Fast New Tab Redirect Reborn
A rebirth of the [fast-new-tab-redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-new-tab-redirect/ohnfdmfkceojnmepofncbddpdicdjcoi?hl=en) by fumito80.

Change the redirect page to something a little more personal.

This extension enables to user to select custom URLs to replace their default Chrome new tab page.

Although the new tab page has gotten better of these years, some (myself included) require something a little personal. This extension allows user freedom in a lightweight and snappy package. 

Privacy Policy: Regarding the permissions required to automate the new URL redirect, this extension does not and will never record any user data. 
There is no hidden communication with any external sites. 

This project is open source, and I would love your input to what should be changed, as well as any improvements.
